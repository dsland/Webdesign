            <h1>Benefits of Honey</h1>
            <div class="benefits">
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h2>Rich in Antioxidants</h2>
                    <p>Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h2>Natural Cough Medicine</h2>
                    <p>Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study, it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that contain dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppressant. You can create your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with herbal tea or warm water and lemon.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h2>Lowers Blood Pressure</h2>
                    <p>Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h2>Improves Cholesterol</h2>
                    <p>Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%. Honey May also increase HDL (good) cholesterol by about 3%</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h2>Improves Heart Health</h2>
                    <p>It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavinoids, which may support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm those findings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h2>Antibacterial Properties</h2>
                    <p>Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level. This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get dehydrated and die off.</p>

                    <p>I have been trying to embrace a more holistic life style and focusing on having a more natural, low processing and preservative diet. I have opted to reduce my sugar intake and change out to honey. I feel more assure that MTA honey valley is of the purest form as I have seen the GMPs employed by this company and have confidence in their ethical practices. I also used honey in my skin care routine and have been seeing big positive changes.</p>
