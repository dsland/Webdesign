        <p>Kadei Sowasosu a returnee victim of isekai shares his experiences after being reborn in another world. Not only was he reborn in a 
        prehistoric world at the bottom of the food chain, he was also given the gruesome task of surviving the coming of Chicxulub and finding a mate, 
        if he wanted the chance to regain his original life</p>

                <h2>The Task At Hand</h2>
                <p>
                    Kadei, another victim of truck-kun was added to the list of those who thought they died only to be reborn in a new world. However, 
                    Kadei was surprised to not only find himself in a prehistoric world. He was also no longer human but a slightly larger Ostrich in a 
                    world filled with dinosaurs. At the moment of transmigration he was provided with details on tasks he needed to complete, the first 
                    was to survive Chicxulub and the second was to find a mate and make sure she survived with him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was reportedly very difficult for him to adjust to this new situation in a world where there was a lack of technology. Not only 
                    that, he was the first of a newly evolved species in that time and was constantly seen as prey. Even his food was several times larger 
                    than himself which nearly resulted in him starving to death on several accounts.

                <h2>It Really Isnt That Bad</h2>
                <p>
                    Kadei, realizing that the current events lined up perfectly with historic records from his previous world, started preparing for the 
                    arrival of Chicxulub, the meteor that resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time a second "sun" appeared in the sky, he was already prepared and as it grew closer he even managed to gain the favor of a 
                    lady pterodactyl. This was only by offering her shelter in a poorly constructed replica of a bomb shelter and in return the pterodactyl 
                    lady helped him with hunting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By working together they survived what should have resulted in their annihilation and his mission was complete. Lucky for him, the 
                    dreaded dinosaur mating was not necessary and his soul was once more transported to his comatose body that was hospitalized in this world.

                    One question being asked, is it possible that his account of events are true? Or was his entire experience a long dream he had while in deep sleep. 
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Recently, stories of living an entire other life after being hit by this mysterious truck have popped up all over the world. 
                    Is this all just a coincidence? Or are people really being transmigrated to new worlds in order to complete specific tasks?
                </p>  
                <p>
                    And one more burning question remains, what happened to those who were unable to complete a task given?
